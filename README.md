# Java File Transfer
A client/server Java application for peer-to-peer file transfers over UDP and TCP. 
This project was done in collaboration with others and my main focus was server side.

## What I learned
- Java Sockets UDP and TCP
- Java Concurrency (Threads)
- Peer to Peer software (server only handles initial requests)
- File integrity checks
- Networking and Packets

## How to run
- `cd src`
- `make s` to compile and run the server
- `make c` to compile and run the client
- NOTE: run 2 clients as well as the server
